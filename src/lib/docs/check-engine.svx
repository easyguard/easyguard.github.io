# Check Engine

This is a simple utility to run checks and report results.

It will run all checks in it's directory (`/etc/config/checks` by default) every 5 seconds. If a check doesn't return exit code 0, it will create a file at `/tmp/check-engine` with the exit code and stdout as well as stderr.
